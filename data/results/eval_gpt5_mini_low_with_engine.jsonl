While some predictions like 'king-and-pawn endgame' and 'zugzwang/drawish symmetry' have relevance to endgame scenarios, they do not capture the specific strategic notion of opposition. Other themes such as 'opposite-side pawn play', 'passed pawn potential', 'pawn majorities', and 'inactive pieces (only kings and pawns)' introduce concepts that may apply in other contexts but do not align with the main theme of opposition in this position. The overlap is limited and many predictions diverge from the major concept, warranting a score that reflects this lack of relevant themes."}

The predicted themes focus on various tactical and strategic elements (like 'material,' 'king activity,' and 'passed pawn') that could contribute to a position but do not capture the essence of Zugzwang. There is negligible semantic overlap, and while some themes may be relevant in broader strategic contexts, they do not adequately reflect the specific nature of Zugzwang. Therefore, the prediction is fundamentally off-target, leading to a low score."}

The predicted themes are focused more on material comparison and king activity, lacking a direct relation to the square rule itself. Thus, while there is some thematic overlap in a general chess context, it does not capture the essence of the ground truth, resulting in a poor rating."}

The themes like 'opposition' and 'king activity' are relevant to strategic play but do not encapsulate 'breakthroughs' or 'defects' effectively. Moreover, the focus on 'drawish pawn endgame' and 'blocked center' detracts from the main themes indicated in the ground truth. This results in a fair rating, reflecting that while some relevant ideas are touched upon, many key themes are missing, leading to a lack of overall coherence with the ground truth."}

However, none of these themes capture the essence of 'Cutting the path', which suggests a focus on controlling or blocking opponent's resources or movement. Themes like 'passed pawn' and 'promotion' may imply some route to victory but do not directly connect to the concept of controlling an opponent's path or options.

Many of the predicted themes, such as 'king activity' and 'blocked pawn structure,' are relevant to endgames in general but do not specifically relate to the core idea of the corresponding square system.
